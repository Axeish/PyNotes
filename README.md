# PyNotes
Welcome to my journey towards mastering Python! This repository is my personal space where I build, learn, and document everything related to Python programming. As I grow, so does this repository. It is a living, evolving book of code, ideas, systems, and solutions.

---

##  Goals
- Build a solid foundation in **Python basics**.
- Solve **LeetCode problems** with categorized techniques and detailed explanations.
- Create **personal documentation** like a Python reference book.
- Explore **fun and practical projects** to apply concepts.
- Understand and practice **system design** with Python.
- Build and document **REST APIs**, including **security and authentication**.
- Learn and practice **unit testing and test automation**.
- Dive into **advanced Python topics**.
- Share and reflect through **tutorial-style notes and code**.
- Craft reusable **algorithms and modules**.

##  How I Use This Repo
- I treat this like a **notebook + project portfolio**.
- As I study or complete something, I create folders and markdown files.
- I add **code examples**, **explanations**, and **real-world use cases**.
- I return often to refactor and improve.
- Every section is self-contained and documented with context.

---

##  Highlight Topics
- Python 3 syntax and best practices
- OOP in Python (classes, inheritance, dunder methods)
- Web API design with FastAPI and Flask
- Security practices in Python (OAuth2, JWT, encryption)
- Clean code and testing using `pytest`
- System design case studies using Python
- Fun projects like games, utilities, or automation tools
- Jupyter notebooks and data storytelling
- LeetCode solution walkthroughs by topic (array, graph, tree, etc.)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python 3.x
- FastAPI / Flask
- Pytest / unittest
- SQLite / PostgreSQL
- Git + GitHub
- Markdown for docs

##  Notes
This is not a tutorial for others — yet.
It's my personal journey, shared in public.
Eventually, I might polish parts of it into tutorials, blog posts, or a portfolio.

Feel free to explore and use anything here as inspiration.
